# Hi there, I'm Jadala Ramani! üëã 


A passionate DevOps Professional with 3 years of hands-on experience in AWS Cloud and DevOps practices. I specialize in building, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Docker, ensuring scalable and resilient environments. My expertise comes across CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, along with agile development supported by efficient Git branching strategies. I have a strong command over Linux, scripting with Shell/Bash and Python, and managing containerized applications using Kubernetes and Helm Charts. For monitoring and observability, I utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios, while maintaining security with solutions like Trivy for image scanning. My AWS experience includes working with services like EC2, S3, VPC, Route53, CloudWatch, RDS, and IAM. I also have experience with JIRA and ServiceNow for agile project management. Driven by automation and continuous improvement, I am dedicated to creating seamless deployments, optimizing workflows, and delivering high-quality solutions in DevOps and cloud environments.

üöÄ **I am open to collaborating** on projects related to **DevOps, cloud computing, automation, and CI/CD pipelines**. I am always eager to **learn new technologies** and contribute to innovative solutions that drive efficiency and scalability in cloud infrastructure.
